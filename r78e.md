# nushell/nushell: example outputs PR

Should close #8035.

# Description
this PR adds, when it is defined in the `examples` method of the `Command` implementations, the output of the examples to the output of the `help` command.

# User-Facing Changes
the output of the `help <command>` command is now augmented with the outputs of the examples, when they are defined.

# Tests + Formatting
no new tests have been added, as there is no real functionality to be tested, only previously existing pieces put together in the `documentation.rs`

- :heavy_check_mark: `cargo fmt --all`
- :x: `cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings -D clippy::unwrap_used -A clippy::needless_collect` => i'll fix that asap :+1: 
- :heavy_check_mark: `cargo test --workspace`

# After Submitting
> **Warning**
> maybe that would require generating the web pages of the commands again? :thinking:
